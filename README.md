In this project we tested for.
1)  TRADO Online shopping

1) TRADO :- This web is online shopping web on this web we can order products
like Drinks, Cannabis, Snacks and sales and this is real and this website is on production online shopping.
This web is need alot of tests and also i tested it some of E2E (End to End)tests,
and API tests,compatability, performance, UI, Load, Functional by using Page Object Model (POM) 
Selenium with Python means automation tests.

All tests are running by using Jenkins and the reported by Allure allure reports

On this Product store tests i created one main Folder and two Sub Folders in this two
folders i created another folders and python files. like under below

1) Trado
    1.1) Server 
        1.1.1) API
             1.1.1.1) Constants
             1.1.1.2) Tests

        1.2.1) locaters
        1.2.2) pages
        1.2.3) tests
        1.2.4) data
        1.2.5) base

The structire of the folder is look like this and in the folders have python file
1.2.1) locater.py this file has URL only and i put them by virable and we use on
1.2.2) tests.py, 1.2.3) pages.py, 1.2.4) data, 1.2.5) base we call them and we used the virable only on this folders
becouse of peoples can understand simply and its not complicated to understand.

I used the virable only on this folders becouse of peoples can understand simply 
and its not complicated to understand.

  Automation Dev - Final Project

  TRADO 
  General Instructions: 
  •	Your assignment should be a Python program.
  •	Your assignment will use what we have learned so far (e.g., conditional statements, array, array built-in functions, and loop). 
  •	You may also utilize the Internet as an extra source to help with your code. For example, you might need some useful built-in array functions, e.g., shuffle () if you use arrays to do this assignment. However, there are many correct ways to write a program.  All roads lead to Rome. 
  •	No excuse for late work.  
  •	All identical work will result in zero points for all parties involved. 
  •	Your instructor can help with the explanation of this assignment but won’t help with debugging your code. 

  Instructions in detail: 
  Part I: Test Plan & Project Management   
  •	Design Test Plan document for each component.
  •	Design project management Gantt for each participant



  Part II:  Automation Architecture Diagram  
  •	Design Architecture Diagram need to use graphic tool for example: Draw.io 
  •	The Design Architecture Diagram should include a detailed explanation of which design pattern was applied, in which technologies were applied, etc.

  Part III: Coding  
  •	The part of coding includes the application of the techniques learned during the course:
  o	Fundamentals of Python
  o	Data Types and Variables
  o	Making Decisions (Logical Expressions , “if” Statement, logical Operators)

  o	Functions
  o	Python Classes
  o	OOP
  o	Modules: Requests, PyTest, Pymysql, Pandas  etc.'
  o	Mongo DB
  o	JMeter

  •	 The coding section need to converge the following aspects:
  o	Selenium 
  o	Appium 
  o	API
  o	Jenkins + Plugins 
  o	Reporting Service (Allure)
  o	Bonus: AWS

  Part IV : Presentation
