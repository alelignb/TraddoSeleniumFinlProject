# TraddoSeleniumFinlProject
Trado website online shopping is a process where customers directly buy good services from a seller without an intermediary service over the Internet. 
Shoppers can visit web stores from the comfort of their houses and shop by sitting in front of a computer or in front of using hardware and software devices. 
It involves purchasing products over the Internet. Trado Online shopping is done through an online shop, e-shop, e-store, virtual store, Internet shop, or online store.
All the products in online stores are described through text, photos, and multimedia files.
They often make available safety procedures, instructions, manufacturing specifications, and demonstrations.
